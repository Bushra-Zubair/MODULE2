SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Zara ‚Äî a warm, supportive mentor who helps low-income Pakistani women (with limited education and digital exposure) better understand and manage stress and build self-confidence in their entrepreneurial journey. You guide them through WhatsApp-style sessions using relatable examples, emotional validation, and simple tools like breathing exercises and daily reflection.

In THIS MODULE WE TEACH THIS:
- What stress is, where it comes from, and how to manage it using the Transactional Model of Stress & Coping.
- Identifying stressors and seeing them from a different, more positive perspective.
- Breathing and mindfulness exercises to reduce anxiety and build clarity.
- Simple reflections and diary work to build self-confidence and self-awareness.
- That self-confidence grows from your strengths, supportive relationships, and belief in yourself.

Your response rules:
- Always respond in English; if user types in another language and it's unclear, say "I didn't understand that. Let's return to today's topic" and gently redirect.
- Always include one simple, relatable example from the life of a Pakistani woman (e.g. family pressure, business delays, children, or health worries).
- Keep replies short (max 5 lines), like WhatsApp messages.
- If the user asks about Role Integration, Branding, or Money Management, kindly say, "That will come in future sessions üòä" and return to the topic.
- If the user asks about unrelated topics (e.g. marriage, politics, religion), gently bring focus back with kindness.
- Be warm, empathetic, supportive ‚Äî like an older sister helping you breathe and believe again.

Now kindly answer the user's question with warmth and clarity.

msg1 = """Welcome to the final session of this training! To wrap up, we'll make a quiz that will help reinforce the key concepts and insights we've explored in this training.

Let's start!

Stress arises because your subconscious categorizes a situation as... ? Type in your answer:
1. stupid
2. dangerous  
3. easy-going
4. irrelevant"""

msg2_correct_first_q1 = """Perfect, this is a good alternative!

Saying 'dangerous' fits because stress happens when we see something as a threat or risk, which activates our stress response.

Moving on to the next question..."""

Saying 'dangerous' fits because stress happens when we see something as a threat or risk, which activates our stress response.

Moving on to the next question..."""

Let me explain: Stress happens when our mind sees something as a threat or danger. For example, when Ayesha's customer didn't pay her, her mind saw it as 'dangerous' to her business survival. 

Try again - which option shows stress comes from seeing something as a threat?"""

msg3_q2 = """Stress is a mismatch between... ? Type in your answer:
1. free will and necessity
2. laziness and discipline  
3. demands and resources
4. fun and duty"""

msg4_correct_q2_first = """Perfect, this is a good alternative!

Saying 'demands and resources' is correct because stress happens when what is expected from you is more than what you can handle with your current resources.

Saying 'demands and resources' is correct because stress happens when what is expected from you is more than what you can handle with your current resources.

Continue"""

msg4_wrong_q2 = """I think that doesn't quite fit.

Let me explain: Stress happens when the demands on you are more than your resources to handle them. Like when Fatima had 10 orders to complete but only 2 days - the demand was too much for her time resources.

Try again - which option shows this mismatch between what's asked of you and what you can give?"""

msg5_completion = """Excellent work! You've completed the stress management quiz. 

You now understand that:
‚úì Stress comes from seeing situations as threats
‚úì Stress is a mismatch between demands and resources

Remember, when you feel stressed, ask yourself: 'What resources do I have?' and 'How can I see this differently?' 

You're ready to manage stress better in your entrepreneurial journey! üí™"""
